The data used in this study is the '100-Driver' dataset.

The '100-Driver' dataset is a comprehensive and diverse collection of data used for identifying driver distraction behaviors, it is primarily utilized for training and evaluating the performance of machine learning and deep learning models in monitoring driver attention states. The dataset consists of a vast number of driving video clips, featuring over 100 drivers with varying ages, genders, and driving habits engaging in various distracting behaviors within real-world driving environments, such as using mobile phones, eating, adjusting in-car facilities, and conversing with passengers. These extensive driving scenarios and diverse distraction behaviors provide detailed and comprehensive data support for the study of driver distraction detection.

The dataset originates from surveillance videos captured during actual road driving situations, with no interference from interior vehicle cameras, to ensure the authenticity and validity of the data. Through meticulous labeling and categorization processes, researchers have been able to utilize the '100-Driver' dataset to develop algorithms that can accurately predict driver distractions. This advancement aids in enhancing traffic safety, as it can help prevent accidents caused by distracted drivers.

In summary, the "100-Driver" dataset serves as a large-scale source for classifying driver distraction behavior with high diversity. It is derived from real road driving environments containing an extensive range of samples representing different populations along with numerous examples showcasing various distraction behaviors within complex driving situations. Its significance lies in its ability to promote the development of intelligent transportation systems' technology pertaining to driver attention monitoring.
